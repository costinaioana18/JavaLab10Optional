# JavaLab10Optional

I have completed the following optional tasks:

- implementing the functionalities of the game, using the classes Board, Player. The board has a 15*15 matrix where players can insert pieces _( only in the available places )_. After each submit the program will check if there is a winner, by checking if there are any 5 identical consecutive pieces in a row, column or diagonal.

- the clients can send commands to the server such as 'Join' 'Exit' and submitting a move, by writing 2 integers representing the row and the column number where he wants to insert a piece

- the server is responsible with the game management and mediating the players.

- once a game is finished, the app creates an html file containing the game's representation. I have not uploaded it to a web server tho.


**to see how the html looks like, check HTMLGameRepresentation.jpg**

**to see how the board looks like, how the winner is announced and other game functionalities ( like the way a player cannot submit a move when selecting a place is already occupied), check output10.jpg**
